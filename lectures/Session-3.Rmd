## Agenda

1. Review (and upgrade) 
2. Tame and tidy data
3. Data Summarization

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
wine <- read_csv("../resources/winemag-data.csv")
```

# Review

## Filter, arrange, and select

### Load the wine dataset and output a tibble of...
1. Pinot Noir 
2. from Oregon
3. in descending order by points,
4. and ascending order by price,
5. that only shows points, price and title

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>%
  filter(variety=="Pinot Noir") %>% 
  arrange(desc(points), price) %>% 
  select(points, price, title)
```

## Summarize

### What are the mean price and points for Oregon Pinot Noir?

*Hint:* Use skim()

## Solution

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(skimr)
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>%
  filter(variety=="Pinot Noir") %>% 
  arrange(desc(points), price) %>% 
  select(points, price) %>% 
  skim()
```

## Next level...

- and ('&') vs. or ('|')
- not ('!') and not equal ('!=')
- top_n() and top_frac()

### Use logical operators and the top_n function to find...
1. the top 10 French or Italian wines by price.
2. showing only points, price and title 
3. arranged by points descending.

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="France" | country=="Italy") %>% 
  top_n(10,price) %>% 
  arrange(desc(points)) %>% 
  select(points, price, title)
```

## More practice

### Use logical operators and the top_n function to find... 
1. the top 5 Oregon wines by points 
2. that aren't Chardonnay
3. Showing only points, price and title
4. arranged by price ascending.

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(variety!="Chardonnay") %>% 
  top_n(5,points) %>% 
  arrange(price) %>% 
  select(points, price, title)
```

- Why are there more than 5 rows? 

## Even more practice

### Use logical operators and top_frac functions to find... 
1. the top 5% by points
2. of Oregon wines
3. that are neither Pinot Noir nor Chardonnay
4. Showing only points, price and title
5. arranged by points descending and price ascending.

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(variety != "Pinot Noir" & variety != "Chardonnay") %>% 
  top_frac(.01,points) %>% 
  select(points, price, title) %>%
  arrange(desc(points), price)
```

# Tame and tidy data

## Philosophy (review)

- Tame data is data with understandable column names and well-formatted values
- Tidy data is data with:
  + Each variable must have its own column
  + Each observation must have its own row
  + Each value must have its own cell

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy.png")
```


This is often the difference between data that is considered "long" and data that is considered "wide."

## Different data types

\*Each column must contain values of the **SAME** type

- Numeric (integers, fractions)
- Character (Words)
- Factor (Categories)
- Date (also includes time)
- Logical (true or false, 1 or 0)

See [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/data-types-and-objects.html) for more information.

## New dataframes

So far, we've been piping operations from a single dataframe. But what if you want to save the result for later?

```{r}
wine_oregon <- wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon")

wine_oregon
```

## Spread and Gather

These are functions to reshape your data. Let's first summarize the wine data by country and save it to a new dataframe

```{r}
wine_country <- wine %>% 
  filter(variety=="Cabernet Sauvignon" | variety=="Chardonnay" | variety=="Pinot Gris" | variety =="Syrah") %>% 
  group_by(country, variety) %>% 
  summarize(points = mean(points))

wine_country
```

*Note:* Don't stress about the group_by and summarize functions. I'll get to that.

## Spread (from long to wide)

Now let's spread it out so that I've got one column for each variety of wine
```{r}
wine_wide <- wine_country %>% 
  spread(variety, points)
wine_wide
```

## Gather (from wide to long)

Then gather it back up into the original
```{r}
wine_long <- wine_wide %>% 
  gather("variety", "points", 2:5)

wine_long
```

Why are there more rows than the original?

# Data summarization

## Basics

Data summarization involves

- Describing data with numerical summaries
- Visualizing data with graphical summaries

...however, there is a difference in how we describe the data depending on whether it is

- discrete, or
- continuous

## Describing discrete data

```{r}
wine %>% 
  count(country)
```
## A 'tidy' pivot table
```{r}
wine %>% 
  count(country, variety)
```
## Exercise

### Use filter and count to figure out which country has more Chardonnay, France or the US.

## Solution
```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="France" | country=="US") %>% 
  filter(variety=="Chardonnay") %>% 
  count(country)
```


## Visualization basics

### ggplot2 requires the following:
1. Data – Data to visualize.
2. Aesthetics – Mapping graphical elements to data.
3. Geometries – Or “geom,” the graphic representing the data.

## Visualizing discrete data

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="France" | country=="US") %>% 
  filter(variety=="Chardonnay") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=country)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## Let's try a more complicated count
```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Washington" | province=="Oregon" | province=="California") %>% 
  filter(variety=="Cabernet Sauvignon" | variety =="Syrah" | variety=="Pinot Noir") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=province, fill=variety)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## Exercise

### Create a stacked bar graph that shows

1. A count of wines
2. with greater than 97 points
3. from California, Oregon and Washington
4. stacked by variety

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(points >= 98) %>% 
  filter(province=="Washington" | province=="Oregon" | province=="California") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=province, fill=variety)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## Describing continuous data

You can use the summarize function for calculating things like mean, median, variance, min/max, etc.

```{r}
wine %>% 
  summarize(avg_points=mean(points))
```

## Visualizing a continuous distribution

Of course that's not very exciting. Let's graph the distribution of points.

```{r, message=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=points)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

## Visualizing two continuous variables

...or the relationship between points and price

```{r, warning=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=points, y=log(price))) +
  geom_point()
```

## Combining discrete and continuous variables

Somtimes, we want to summarize by a category

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="US") %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>% 
  group_by(province) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    average_points=mean(points),
    average_price=mean(price)) %>% 
  filter(count>100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(average_points))
```

*Note:* the count() function used previously is just a wrapper around summarize(count=n())

## Exercise

### Create a tibble that shows

1. US wines
2. grouped by province and variety,
3. summarized on count and max price
4. with a count greater than 100
5. sorted by count descending

*Hint:* don't forget to filter out the 'NA' prices

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="US") %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>% 
  group_by(province, variety) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    max_price=max(price)) %>% 
  filter(count>100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
```

## Visualizing discrete and continuous

Sometimes we want to visualize a continuous variable by category as a boxplot

```{r, warning=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="California" | province=="Oregon" | province=="Washington") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=province, y=log(price))) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

## Visualizing discrete and continuous (cont'd)

...or as a density function

```{r, warning=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="California" | province=="Oregon" | province=="Washington") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log(price), fill=province)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.4)

```

## Long exercise

### Gather in groups of 3ish and...

1. Choose a driver
2. Choose a country
3. Summarize the wine data from that country (numerically and visually)
4. Write comments about what you find in the markdown
5. Make sure "echo=FALSE" on your chunks
6. Knit to HTML and email me the file.
