## Agenda

1. The R programming environment
2. RMarkdown
3. Intro to Tidyverse

*Strong suggestion:* download some [cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

# The R programming environment

## What is R?

- R is a software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- It is also a programming language
  + Variables (of different types)
  + Structures
  + Functions
  + Syntax

## Using RStudio

- *Console:* where you can execute code
- *Source file:* create and save scripts, which get sent to the console
- *Comments:* document what you are doing
- *Environment:* a snapshot of the current state of affairs
- *Help:* lookup how to do stuff
- *Packages:* bundles of code written by others

## Exercise 

Open RStudio and:

1.  Create a new R script
2.  Create a comment that explains what you are doing
3.  Compute the solution to 2*(28-7)
4.  Run the script

## Solution

```{r}
# Math is fun!
2*(28-7)
```

## Exercise 

1. Edit your R script to assign the solution to 2*(28-7) to a variable
2. Multiply your variable by 42 and then take the square root
3. Display the answer

*Hint:* use `sqrt()`

## Solution

```{r}
# Math is fun!
s <- 2*(28-7)
s <- s*42
sqrt(s)
```


## Functions

Input &rarr; Function &rarr; Output

```{r}
# Exponentiate a number and assign to a variable
s <- exp(42)
s

# Take the log of this variable and display it
log(s)
```

## Packages 

- A package is a collection of functions, documentation, and sometimes data
- There are a number of packages that are part of base R
- You can install other packages from CRAN
- Not all packages are created equal

*Note:* The functions **exp()** and **log()** are part of Base R

## Excercise

1. Install the tidyverse package
2. load tidyverse into memory

## Solution

```{r}
# install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

# RMarkdown

## The what and why of RMarkdown

RMarkdown is a file format that allows you to embed your code directly within your report.

**Why is this important?**

## Preamble

To begin, you need to specify they type of document you want and set some options... 

...you need to write some YAML

```

{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
...but luckily this is all pretty much done for you when you create a new RMarkdown file in RStudio.

## Formatting

```
Plain text

# header 1
## header 2
### header 3 etc.

an equation $ y = mx + b $

image: ![caption]("pathtofile.png")

url: [link text](http://address.com)

> block quote

*italics*

**bold**
```

## Formatting cont'd

```
superscript^2^

- unordered list
- next item
  + some subitems
  + subitem 2
  
1. unordered list
2. next item
  + some subitems
  + subitem 2
  
Table header | Column 2 header
-------------|--------------
cell 1       | cell 2
cell 3       | cell 4

```

## Code Evaluation

**Chunk it**  

\```{r eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}  

\# here is a comment  
my_var <- 42  
my_var

\```

**Inline**  

My favorite variable is: 
```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat("`` `r my_var` ``")
```



## Code Chunk Options

- eval
- echo
- warning
- error
- message
- cache
- fig.width
- fig.height

...and so much more can be found [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

## Exercise: Reproduce the output of this slide

### Some rad markdown
*Note:* Using **markdown** is an **easy** way to marry analysis with report writing.  

The advantages are:

1. Simple, output-agnostic formatting
2. Reproducible results
3. Easy for others to follow your analysis

Example analysis:
```{r}
my_var <- exp(log(42))
```

*Note^2^:* It is also cool because I can embed R code inline. For instance, the value of my_var is `r my_var`.

# Intro to the Tidyverse

## Philosophy

An 'opinionated' collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

- readr – importing data 
- dplyr – manipulating data 
- tidyr – cleaning data 
- ggplot2 – visualizing data

...more are being added regularly

## Importing data (pair up and follow along)

1. Goto [jamesonwatts.github.io](https://jamesonwatts.github.io/), scroll down to the teaching section and click on the GSMDS Class link
2. Find the resources folder and download the [wine-data.csv](https://github.com/jamesonwatts/GSMDS-5001/blob/master/resources/winemag-data.csv) file
3. Create a new R code chunk in your RMD file and add the following:

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
wine <- read_csv("../resources/winemag-data.csv")
```

## Data Frames

```{r, warning=FALSE}
wine <- read_csv("../resources/winemag-data.csv")
```

## Rectangular data

- All columns are variables
- All rows are observations
- Each cell is a value

```{r}
head(wine,5)
```

*Note:* you can also open data files within RStudio just like in Excel

## Let's take a glimpse instead

```{r}
glimpse(wine)
```

## Or a skim
```{r, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
skim(wine)
```


## The Pipe

Starting with a dataset, you can use the pipe operator to perform operations in series.

For instance, I can filter the dataset to only show wines from Oregon

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon")
```

## Multiple Filters

...or I can filter the data so that I only have wines from Oregon that are over $100

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(price > 100) 
```

## Exercise

### Find only the wines with variety "Pinot Gris" that cost less than $10

## Answer
```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(variety=="Pinot Gris") %>% 
  filter(price<10) 
```

why do I put quotes around "Pinot Gris" but not around the price?

## Combining functions

You can also combine functions using the pipe operator. 

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(variety=="Chardonnay") %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  arrange(desc(points), price)
```

## Filtered summary of select variables
Let's summarize the data from the last slide by combining filter with skim and select

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(variety=="Chardonnay") %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>%
  select(price, points) %>% 
  skim()
```



## Long exercise

1. Gather into 4 teams
2. Assign one person to "drive"
3. Create a new RMD file using the default HTML output format
4. Suggest some Oregon wines in the region of...
  + Eola-Amity Hills
  + Dundee Hills
  + Chehalem Mountains
  + Umpqua Valley

Email me the resulting html file with your marked up analysis. Don't forget to justify your recommendations!

## Summary

- R is a programming language (in all its glory and ugliness)
- RMarkdown makes beautiful, reproducible, data science documents
- The Tidyverse is a philosophy (and set of packages) for data science in R

## Bonus
###Beautiful tables with kable
```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(variety=="Chardonnay") %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  arrange(desc(points), price) %>% 
  select(points, price, province, region_1, title) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable(padding=0)
```
