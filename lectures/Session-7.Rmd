## Example A/B test

<div class="columns-2">
 ![](images/smartwool.png){width=95%}
 
  1. Randomly assign customers to treatments
  3. Measure response(s) 
  4. Compare groups to determine how the treatment changes response
</div>

## Why A/B tests work
By **randomizing** over a large number of customers, we create groups that are the same, on average. 

<div class="centered">
![](images/apples.jpg){width=15%}  ![](images/apples.jpg){width=15%}
</div>


Any behavioral differences between these groups is **caused by the treatments** we randomly assigned.

1, 2, 3. Repeat with me. Randomization will set you free.
