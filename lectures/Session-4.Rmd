# Review

## Group_by() 

The group_by() function doesn't actually do anything visible to a dataframe.

Grouping by province shows the same data as...
```{r}
wine %>% 
  group_by(province)
```

## Group_by()

...grouping by both province and variety.
```{r}
wine %>% 
  group_by(province, variety)
```

## Group_by() with summarize()

However, the grouping function sets things up in the background for your summary operations.

```{r}
wine %>% 
  summarize('avg. price'=mean(price))
```

```{r}
wine %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize('avg. price'=mean(price)) %>% 
  head(5)
```

## Exercise

### What are the top five varieties in Argentinia by points?

*Hint:* Use filter(), group_by(), summarize() and top_n() to find your answer

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="Argentina") %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarize(
    'avg_points' = mean(points)
    ) %>% 
  top_n(5,avg_points) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_points))
```

## Advanced summarize()

### Each call to summarize removes one level of grouping.

Note that by running summarize twice, I am back to the results from the previous slide.

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="Argentina") %>% 
  group_by(variety, winery) %>% 
  summarize(points = mean(points)) %>% 
  summarize('avg_points' = mean(points)) %>% 
  top_n(5,avg_points) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_points))
```

## Exercise

1. If needed, open the help file on dplyr::summarize()
2. use summarize() with n_distinct() 
3. to find the number of unique wineries in Argentina

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(country=="Argentina") %>% 
  summarize(winery_count=n_distinct(winery))

wine %>% 
  filter(country=="Argentina") %>% 
  count(winery)
```

# Joining Together

## Relational data

![](images/relational-nycflights.png)

## Definitions

### **Primary keys:** uniquely identifies row in its own dataframe

### **Foreign keys:** uniquely identifies row in another dataframe

## Joining up with World Bank data

```{r, message=FALSE}
pop <- read_csv("../resources/population.csv")
pop
```

## Let's gather, then start with the most recent year

```{r, message=FALSE}
pop <- read_csv("../resources/population.csv") %>% 
  gather(key="year", value = "population", 3:61) %>% 
  rename("country"="Country Name") 
  
pop2017 <- pop %>% 
  filter(year==2017) %>% 
  select(country, population)

pop2017
```

## Try joining with wine on country
```{r, message=FALSE}
wine_pop <- wine %>% 
  inner_join(pop2017) %>% 
  select(country, population, title)

wine_pop
```

But wait... we started with over 120k observations and now we're down to 66k?

## Did we get everything?

 Let's try this again.

```{r, message=FALSE}
wine_pop <- wine %>% 
  left_join(pop2017) %>% 
  select(country, population, title)

wine_pop 
```

...hmmm looks like the US isn't matching. But we'll come back to that.

## Types of joins

- Mutating
  + inner_join()
  + left_join()
  + right_join()
  + full_join()
- Filtering
  + semi_join()
  + anti_join()

What would be the result if I performed an anti_join() with my wine and population dataframes?

## Anti_join

```{r, message=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  anti_join(pop2017) 
```


# Mutation

## Mutation for new variables

The function mutate() from dplyr allows you to create new variables from existing ones.

```{r}
wine %>% 
  mutate(lprice=log(price)) %>% 
  select(price, lprice)
```


## Grouped mutation

You can also mutate by group. For instance, let's say you wanted to standardize prices by variety

```{r, fig.height=3}
wine %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  mutate(npoints = (points-mean(points)) / sd(points)) %>%
  filter(variety == "Riesling" | variety == "Cabernet Sauvignon") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(npoints, fill=variety))+
    geom_density(alpha=0.3)
```

## Conditional mutation

Let's change that pesky 'US' identifier to 'United States' 

```{r}
wine <- wine %>%
  mutate(country=ifelse(country=="US","United States",country))
wine
```

# Strings

## String basics
```{r}
library(stringr)

name <- "Jameson Watts"
name

quote <- '"As soon as you stop wanting something, you get it." - Andy Warhol'
quote

writeLines(quote)
```


## String Operations

```{r}
str_length(quote)
name_quote <- str_c("Name: ", name, "\nQuote: ", quote)
writeLines(name_quote)
```

## Other common string functions
```{r}
str_sub(name_quote,10,30)
str_to_lower(name_quote)
str_locate(name_quote,"Jameson")
```

## Regular expressions

```{r}
library(htmlwidgets)
str_detect(name_quote, "on Wa")
str_detect(name_quote, "on wa")
str_view_all(name_quote, "ou")
```

## More complicated Regex

Placeholders and Repetition

- . maches any character
- \* matches 0 or more
- \+ matches 1 or more
- ? matches 0 or 1

Anchors

- ^ matches start of string
- $ matches end of string

Character classes

- \\d matches any digit.
- \\s matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
- [abc] matches a, b, or c.
- [^abc] matches anything except a, b, or c.


## Some examples

```{r}
str_view_all(name_quote, "a.+s")

wine %>% 
  filter(str_detect(variety,"[Cc]abernet")) %>% 
  select(points, price, variety) %>% 
  arrange(desc(price))
```

## Exercise

1. Use filter() and str_detect() to 
2. find all Oregon wines 
3. with the words 'espresso' and 'black currant' in their description
4. showing variety, price, points and winery


*Note:* these sorts of queries can tax your computer

## Solution
```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(str_detect(description,"[Ee]spresso") & str_detect(description,"[Bb]lack currant")) %>% 
  select(variety, price, points, winery) %>% 
  arrange(desc(points), price)
```


# Bringing it all together

## Combining with mutate

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  mutate(fruity = str_detect(description,"[Ff]ruity")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(points, fill=fruity))+
    geom_density(alpha=.5)
```

## Extracting year from title
```{r}
wine <- wine %>% 
  mutate(year = str_extract(title,"(\\d{4})"))

wine %>% 
  select(title, year)
```

## Graphing points by year

```{r, fig.height=3}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>%
  filter(variety=="Pinot Noir" | variety=="Chardonnay" | variety=="Pinot Gris") %>%
  filter(year >= 1995) %>% 
  group_by(year, variety) %>% 
  summarize(avg_points = mean(points)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=as.integer(year), y=avg_points, color=variety)) +
    geom_line()
  
```


## Joining on more than one column

Now that we've extracted year from the title, we can do a join on both country and year

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
wine %>% 
  left_join(pop) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(population) & !is.na(year)) %>%
  filter(population < 1000000000) %>% 
  group_by(country,year) %>% 
  summarize(population=mean(population),price = mean(price)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(population), y=log(price))) +
    geom_jitter(alpha=.1)+
    geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

## Long Exercise

1. Go to https://data.worldbank.org/indicator
2. Find some cool country data
3. Merge it with the wine data
4. Decide on research question
5. Draw a cool graph that answers the question

## Bonus: joining with yourself

```{r, message=FALSE}
top_wineries <- wine %>% 
  group_by(winery) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_points=mean(points),
    count=n()) %>% 
  filter(count > 10) %>% 
  top_frac(.05,avg_points) %>% 
  left_join(wine)

top_wineries
```
